## Activities

Every screen in Android is an intent. This is mostly true.
For the purpose of this exercise, we will look at `Activities` first and then how these have changed over the years.

An `Activity` is made up of:
1. A `Java` file
2. An `XML` layout file

## Layout

## Learning Goals

The aim of these hours is to learn primarily through doing. Some downsides of this are:
* We may not go deep enough into the theory (it is important you call out when something should be explained)
* Draining (tell me when you want breaks)
* Overwhelming (this is the first time this has been done so do not expect to finish, just have fun with it)
